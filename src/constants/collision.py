# Collision Detection and Damage Constants

# Car Collision Properties
CAR_COLLISION_SHAPES = 4  # number of collision shapes for car (corners)
CAR_COLLISION_RADIUS = 0.3  # radius of corner collision shapes in meters
COLLISION_FORCE_THRESHOLD = 50.0  # minimum force to register as significant collision (increased to ignore light touches)
COLLISION_DAMAGE_FACTOR = 0.001  # damage per unit collision force

# Collision Force Threshold
# Note: Severity classification has been removed - now only track if collision is significant
COLLISION_ACCUMULATED_DISABLE_THRESHOLD = 10000.0  # NÂ·s - accumulated impulse threshold for car disabling
COLLISION_DAMAGE_DECAY_RATE = 1500  # damage decay per second

# Collision Severity Thresholds (for extreme collisions that instantly disable)
COLLISION_SEVERITY_EXTREME = 15000  # Instant disable threshold

# Collision Reporting
MAX_COLLISION_HISTORY = 10  # maximum number of recent collisions to track
COLLISION_COOLDOWN_TIME = 0.1  # seconds between collision reports for same contact

# Stuck Detection Thresholds
STUCK_SPEED_THRESHOLD = 0.5  # m/s - speed below which car might be considered stuck
STUCK_TIME_THRESHOLD = 10.0  # seconds - minimum time before checking movement distance
STUCK_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 1.0  # meters - if car moves less than this in STUCK_TIME_THRESHOLD, it's stuck
STUCK_EXTENDED_TIME_THRESHOLD = 15.0  # seconds - after this time, disable car regardless of movement
STUCK_INPUT_THRESHOLD = 0.1  # minimum input magnitude to consider as "active input"
STUCK_RECENT_INPUT_TIME = 3.0  # seconds - time window to check for recent meaningful inputs

# Backward movement detection
BACKWARD_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD = 25.0  # meters - distance backward before penalty starts
BACKWARD_DISABLE_THRESHOLD = 200.0  # meters - distance backward before car is disabled

# Collision Force Physics Constants (moved from physics.py)
COLLISION_FORCE_SCALE_FACTOR = 0.1  # Scale factor for collision force estimation (realistic car collision forces)
COLLISION_MIN_FORCE = 10.0  # Minimum collision force in Newtons
COLLISION_MAX_FORCE = 50000.0  # Maximum realistic collision force in Newtons for validation
