* in-place environment switching via `env.env_method("switch_to_random")` (preferred; avoids resetting optimizer / normalizers),
* robust fallback that recreates `VecEnv` **while preserving** `VecNormalize` statistics if in-place switching is not available,
* `VecNormalize` for observations **and** rewards,
* stronger, more stable A2C hyperparameters for continuous control (`n_steps`, `ent_coef`, `max_grad_norm`, etc.),
* more robust curriculum gating (longer evals, median + std check),
* learning-rate dampening at switch,
* seeds and logging improvements.

Make sure your `CarEnv` implements a `switch_to_random()` method (preferred), or the fallback will recreate the VecEnv and copy `VecNormalize` stats.

**!!! IMPORTANT: READ A2c.py FOR CODE !!!**

### Notes & Checklist before running

1. **`CarEnv.switch_to_random()`**

   * Preferred: add a `switch_to_random(self)` method to your `CarEnv` that changes its internal `track_file` to random and reloads the track. That enables the in-place switch used by the callback and avoids rebuilding the VecEnv. Example in your `CarEnv`:

     ```python
     def switch_to_random(self):
         self.track_file = None
         self._load_random_track()
     ```
   * If `CarEnv` provides another API to change track, adapt the `env_method` call accordingly.

2. **If `CarEnv` lacks `seed()`**: the code attempts to seed but ignores failure; you can add `seed()` to CarEnv for full determinism.

3. **VecNormalize persistence**: This script keeps one `VecNormalize` wrapper and copies `obs_rms/ret_rms` to the evaluation VecNormalize initially. If fallback recreates the VecEnv, the callback attempts to copy those stats to the new VecNormalize.

4. **Hyperparameter tuning**: The provided hyperparameters are conservative and work well for many continuous tasks. If you still observe issues:

   * increase `n_steps` (e.g., 128) for smoother value estimates,
   * mildly increase `ent_coef` (0.01) if policy collapse occurs,
   * or further lower LR.

5. **Logging & TensorBoard**: Keep an eye on `train/value_loss`, `train/std`, `explained_variance`. If `value_loss` spikes at the switch, the LR dampening factor `post_switch_lr_factor` can be decreased further (e.g., 0.5 -> 0.4).
